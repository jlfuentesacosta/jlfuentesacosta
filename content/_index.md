## About me

I am **Juan Fuentes**, a PhD candidate in Economics at [Boston College](https://www.bc.edu/bc-web/schools/morrissey/departments/economics.html).  
My research lies at the intersection of **Empirical Industrial Organization** and the **Economics of Education**.

In my [Job Market Paper](/files/jmp-juan-fuentes.pdf) I quantify the welfare impact of class-rank admissions policies in higher education.

I will be on the **2025 – 26 job market**.

## Job Market Paper
[Group-Neutral College Access and Student Welfare: Evidence from Chile](/files/jmp-juan-fuentes.pdf)

<details><summary>Abstract</summary>
Group-neutral admission policies aim to promote equity without the political costs of affirmative action, yet their success depends on how disadvantaged students respond to them. I study the welfare effects of Chile's Relative Ranking (RR) rule, which raises college admission scores for the top students at every high school. Using administrative data on the universe of applicants, I estimate a structural model of college choice where the policy alters students' beliefs about admission, thereby changing the set of schools they consider. I find the policy increased average student welfare by 1.5%, concentrating gains among students from public and voucher schools while reducing welfare for students from private schools. Accounting for students' behavioral response is important, as it amplifies the policy's effect by a factor of five relative to the mechanical effect alone. Counterfactuals show that expanding the policy further enhances equity with only a minimal trade-off in the average test scores of admitted students.
